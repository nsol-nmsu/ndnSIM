<div class="textblock"><p>HEAD</p>
<p>0.5.1 - 2015-02-27</p><ul>
<li>Bug: Fixes an issue where some frame data was counted against the max header size limit, resulting in connections that included a lot of frame data immediately after the opening handshake to fail.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix a type in the name of the set method for <code>max_http_body_size</code>. #406 Thank you jplatte for reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>0.5.0 - 2015-01-22</p><ul>
<li>BREAKING UTILITY CHANGE: Deprecated methods <code><a href="http::parser::parse_headers">http::parser::parse_headers</a></code>, <code><a href="http::response::parse_complete">http::response::parse_complete</a></code>, and <code><a href="http::request::parse_complete">http::request::parse_complete</a></code> have been removed.</li>
<li>Security: Disabled SSLv3 in example servers.</li>
<li>Feature: Adds basic support for accessing HTTP request bodies in the http handler. #181</li>
<li>Feature: Adds the ability to register a shutdown handler when using the iostream transport. This provides a clean interface for triggering the shut down of external sockets and other cleanup without hooking in to higher level WebSocket handlers.</li>
<li>Feature: Adds the ability to register a write handler when using the iostream transport. This handler can be used to handle transport output in place of registering an ostream to write to.</li>
<li>Feature: Adds a new logging policy that outputs to syslog. #386 Thank you Tom Hughes for submitting the initial version of this policy.</li>
<li>Improvement: Message payload logging now prints text for text messages rather than binary.</li>
<li>Improvement: Overhaul of handshake state machine. Should make it impossible for exceptions to bubble out of transport methods like <code>io_service::run</code>.</li>
<li>Improvement: Overhaul of handshake error reporting. Fail handler error codes will be more detailed and precise. Adds new [fail] and [http] logging channels that log failed websocket connections and successful HTTP connections respectively. A new aggregate channel package, <code>alevel::access_core</code>, allows enabling connect, disconnect, fail, and http together. Successful HTTP connections will no longer trigger a fail handler.</li>
<li>Improvement: Ability to terminate connection during an http handler to cleanly suppress the default outgoing HTTP response.</li>
<li>Documentation: Add Sending &amp; Receiving Messages step to chapter one of the <code>utility_client</code> tutorial. Update <code>utility_client</code> example to match.</li>
<li>Cleanup: Removes unused files &amp; STL includes. Adds required STL includes. Normalizes include order.</li>
<li>Bug: Fixes a fatal state error when a handshake response is completed immediately after that handshake times out. #389</li>
<li>Bug: MinGW fixes; C++11 feature detection, localtime use. #393 Thank you Schebb for reporting, code, and testing.</li>
<li>Bug: Fixes an issue where <code>websocketpp::exception::what()</code> could return an out of scope pointer. #397 Thank you fabioang for reporting.</li>
<li>Bug: Fixes an issue where endpoints were not reset properly after a call to <code>endpoint::listen</code> failed. #390 Thank you wyyqyl for reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>0.4.0 - 2014-11-04</p><ul>
<li>BREAKING API CHANGE: All WebSocket++ methods now throw an exception of type <code><a class="el" href="classwebsocketpp_1_1exception.html">websocketpp::exception</a></code> which derives from <code>std::exception</code>. This normalizes all exception types under the standard exception hierarchy and allows WebSocket++ exceptions to be caught in the same statement as others. The error code that was previously thrown is wrapped in the exception object and can be accessed via the <code>websocketpp::exception::code()</code> method.</li>
<li>BREAKING API CHANGE: Custom logging policies have some new required constructors that take generic config settings rather than pointers to std::ostreams. This allows writing logging policies that do not involve the use of std::ostream. This does not affect anyone using the built in logging policies.</li>
<li>BREAKING UTILITY CHANGE: <code>websocketpp::lib::net::htonll</code> and <code>websocketpp::lib::net::ntohll</code> have been prefixed with an underscore to avoid conflicts with similarly named macros in some operating systems. If you are using the WebSocket++ provided 64 bit host/network byte order functions you will need to switch to the prefixed versions.</li>
<li>BREAKING UTILITY CHANGE: The signature of <code>base64_encode</code> has changed from <code>websocketpp::base64_encode(unsigned char const *, unsigned int)</code> to <code><a class="el" href="namespacewebsocketpp.html#aff36d40583424a2c879df02219133af8" title="Encode a char buffer into a base64 string. ">websocketpp::base64_encode(unsigned char const *, size_t)</a></code>.</li>
<li>BREAKING UTILITY CHANGE: The signature of <code>sha1::calc</code> has changed from <code>websocketpp::sha1::calc(void const *, int, unsigned char *)</code> to <code>websocketpp::sha1::calc(void const *, size_t, unsigned char *)</code></li>
<li>Feature: Adds incomplete <code>minimal_server</code> and <code>minimal_client</code> configs that can be used to build custom configs without pulling in the dependencies of <code>core</code> or <code>core_client</code>. These configs will offer a stable base config to future-proof custom configs.</li>
<li>Improvement: Core library no longer has std::iostream as a dependency. std::iostream is still required for the optional iostream logging policy and iostream transport.</li>
<li>Bug: C++11 Chrono support was being incorrectly detected by the <code>boost_config</code> header. Thank you Max Dmitrichenko for reporting and a patch.</li>
<li>Bug: use of <code>std::put_time</code> is now guarded by a unique flag rather than a chrono library flag. Thank you Max Dmitrichenko for reporting.</li>
<li>Bug: Fixes non-thread safe use of std::localtime. #347 #383</li>
<li>Compatibility: Adjust usage of std::min to be more compatible with systems that define a min(...) macro.</li>
<li>Compatibility: Removes unused parameters from all library, test, and example code. This assists with those developing with -Werror and -Wunused-parameter #376</li>
<li>Compatibility: Renames ntohll and htonll methods to avoid conflicts with platform specific macros. #358 #381, #382 Thank you logotype, unphased, svendjo</li>
<li>Cleanup: Removes unused functions, fixes variable shadow warnings, normalizes all whitespace in library, examples, and tests to 4 spaces. #376</li>
</ul>
<p>0.3.0 - 2014-08-10</p><ul>
<li>Feature: Adds <code>start_perpetual</code> and <code>stop_perpetual</code> methods to asio transport These may be used to replace manually managed <code>asio::io_service::work</code> objects</li>
<li>Feature: Allow setting pong and handshake timeouts at runtime.</li>
<li>Feature: Allows changing the listen backlog queue length.</li>
<li>Feature: Split tcp init into pre and post init.</li>
<li>Feature: Adds URI method to extract query string from URI. Thank you Banaan for code. #298</li>
<li>Feature: Adds a compile time switch to asio transport config to disable certain multithreading features (some locks, asio strands)</li>
<li>Feature: Adds the ability to pause reading on a connection. Paused connections will not read more data from their socket, allowing TCP flow control to work without blocking the main thread.</li>
<li>Feature: Adds the ability to specify whether or not to use the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> TCP socket option. The default for this value has been changed from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Feature: Adds the ability to specify a maximum message size.</li>
<li>Feature: Adds <code>close::status::get_string(...)</code> method to look up a human readable string given a close code value.</li>
<li>Feature: Adds <code>connection::read_all(...)</code> method to iostream transport as a convenience method for reading all data into the connection buffer without the end user needing to manually loop on <code>read_some</code>.</li>
<li>Improvement: Open, close, and pong timeouts can be disabled entirely by setting their duration to 0.</li>
<li>Improvement: Numerous performance improvements. Including: tuned default buffer sizes based on profiling, caching of handler binding for async reads/writes, non-malloc allocators for read/write handlers, disabling of a number of questionably useful range sanity checks in tight inner loops.</li>
<li>Improvement: Cleaned up the handling of TLS related errors. TLS errors will now be reported with more detail on the info channel rather than all being <code>tls_short_read</code> or <code>pass_through</code>. In addition, many cases where a TLS short read was in fact expected are no longer classified as errors. Expected TLS short reads and quasi-expected socket shutdown related errors will no longer be reported as unclean WebSocket shutdowns to the application. Information about them will remain in the info error channel for debugging purposes.</li>
<li>Improvement: <code>start_accept</code> and <code>listen</code> errors are now reported to the caller either via an exception or an ec parameter.</li>
<li>Improvement: Outgoing writes are now batched for improved message throughput and reduced system call and TCP frame overhead.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix some cases of calls to empty lib::function objects.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix memory leak of connection objects due to cached handlers holding on to reference counted pointers. #310 Thank you otaras for reporting.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix issue with const endpoint accessors (such as <code>get_user_agent</code>) not compiling due to non-const mutex use. #292 Thank you logofive for reporting.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix handler allocation crash with multithreaded <code>io_service</code>.</li>
<li>Bug: Fixes incorrect whitespace handling in header parsing. #301 Thank you Wolfram Schroers for reporting</li>
<li>Bug: Fix a crash when parsing empty HTTP headers. Thank you Thingol for reporting.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix a crash following use of the <code>stop_listening</code> function. Thank you Thingol for reporting.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix use of variable names that shadow function parameters. The library should compile cleanly with -Wshadow now. Thank you giszo for reporting. #318</li>
<li>Bug: Fix an issue where <code>set_open_handshake_timeout</code> was ignored by server code. Thank you Robin Rowe for reporting.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix an issue where custom timeout values weren't being propagated from endpoints to new connections.</li>
<li>Bug: Fix a number of memory leaks related to server connection failures. #323 #333 #334 #335 Thank you droppy and aydany for reporting and patches. reporting.</li>
<li>Compatibility: Fix compile time conflict with Visual Studio's MIN/MAX macros. Thank you Robin Rowe for reporting.</li>
<li>Documentation: Examples and test suite build system now defaults to clang on OS X</li>
</ul>
<p>0.3.0-alpha4 - 2013-10-11</p><ul>
<li>HTTP requests ending normally are no longer logged as errors. Thank you Banaan for reporting. #294</li>
<li>Eliminates spurious expired timers in certain error conditions. Thank you Banaan for reporting. #295</li>
<li>Consolidates all bundled library licenses into the COPYING file. #294</li>
<li>Updates bundled sha1 library to one with a cleaner interface and more straight-forward license. Thank you lotodore for reporting and Evgeni Golov for reviewing. #294</li>
<li>Re-introduces strands to asio transport, allowing <code>io_service</code> thread pools to be used (with some limitations).</li>
<li>Removes endpoint code that kept track of a connection list that was never used anywhere. Removes a lock and reduces connection creation/deletion complexity from O(log n) to O(1) in the number of connections.</li>
<li>A number of internal changes to transport APIs</li>
<li>Deprecates iostream transport <code>readsome</code> in favor of <code>read_some</code> which is more consistent with the naming of the rest of the library.</li>
<li>Adds preliminary signaling to iostream transport of eof and fatal transport errors</li>
<li>Updates transport code to use shared pointers rather than raw pointers to prevent asio from retaining pointers to connection methods after the connection goes out of scope. #293 Thank you otaras for reporting.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where custom headers couldn't be set for client connections Thank you Jerry Win and Wolfram Schroers for reporting.</li>
<li>Fixes a compile error on visual studio when using interrupts. Thank you Javier Rey Neira for reporting this.</li>
<li>Adds new 1012 and 1013 close codes per IANA registry</li>
<li>Add <code>set_remote_endpoint</code> method to iostream transport.</li>
<li>Add <code>set_secure</code> method to iostream transport.</li>
<li>Fix typo in .gitattributes file. Thank you jstarasov for reporting this. #280</li>
<li>Add missing locale include. Thank you Toninoso for reporting this. #281</li>
<li>Refactors <code>asio_transport</code> endpoint and adds full documentation and exception free varients of all methods.</li>
<li>Removes <code>asio_transport</code> endpoint method cancel(). Use <code>stop_listen()</code> instead</li>
<li>Wrap internal <code>io_service</code> <code>run_one()</code> method</li>
<li>Suppress error when trying to shut down a connection that was already closed</li>
</ul>
<p>0.3.0-alpha3 - 2013-07-16</p><ul>
<li>Minor refactor to bundled sha1 library</li>
<li>HTTP header comparisons are now case insensitive. #220, #275</li>
<li>Refactors URI to be exception free and not use regular expressions. This eliminates the dependency on boost or C++11 regex libraries allowing native C++11 usage on GCC 4.4 and higher and significantly reduces staticly built binary sizes.</li>
<li>Updates handling of Server and User-Agent headers to better handle custom settings and allow suppression of these headers for security purposes.</li>
<li>Fix issue where pong timeout handler always fired. Thank you Steven Klassen for reporting this bug.</li>
<li>Add ping and pong endpoint wrapper methods</li>
<li>Add <code>get_request()</code> pass through method to connection to allow calling methods specific to the HTTP policy in use.</li>
<li>Fix issue compile error with <code>WEBSOCKETPP_STRICT_MASKING</code> enabled and another issue where <code>WEBSOCKETPP_STRICT_MASKING</code> was not applied to incoming messages. Thank you Petter Norby for reporting and testing these bugs. #264</li>
<li>Add additional macro guards for use with boost_config. Thank you breyed for testing and code. #261</li>
</ul>
<p>0.3.0-alpha2 - 2013-06-09</p><ul>
<li>Fix a regression that caused servers being sent two close frames in a row to end a connection uncleanly. #259</li>
<li>Fix a regression that caused spurious frames following a legitimate close frames to erroneously trigger handlers. #258</li>
<li>Change default HTTP response error code when no http_handler is defined from 500/Internal Server Error to 426/Upgrade Required</li>
<li>Remove timezone from logger timestamp to work around issues with the Windows implementation of strftime. Thank you breyed for testing and code. #257</li>
<li>Switch integer literals to char literals to improve VCPP compatibility. Thank you breyed for testing and code. #257</li>
<li>Add MSVCPP warning suppression for the bundled SHA1 library. Thank you breyed for testing and code. #257</li>
</ul>
<p>0.3.0-alpha1 - 2013-06-09</p><ul>
