O\+SX provides a standard way to start system daemons, monitor their health, and restart when they die.

\subsection*{Initial setup }

Edit {\ttfamily net.\+named-\/data.\+nfd} correcting paths for {\ttfamily nfd} binary, configuration and log files. \begin{DoxyVerb}# Copy launchd.plist for NFD
sudo cp net.named-data.nfd.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.named-data.nfd.plist
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Assumptions in the default scripts}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily nfd} is installed into {\ttfamily /usr/local/bin}
\item Configuration file is {\ttfamily /usr/local/etc/ndn/nfd.conf}
\item {\ttfamily nfd} will be run as root
\item Log files will be written to {\ttfamily /usr/local/var/log/ndn} folder, which is owned by user {\ttfamily ndn}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Creating users}

If {\ttfamily ndn} user does not exists, it needs to be manually created (procedure copied from \href{https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/base/src/port1.0/portutil.tcl}{\tt macports script}). Update uid/gid if 6363 is already used. \begin{DoxyVerb}# Create user `ndn`
sudo dscl . -create /Users/ndn UniqueID 6363

# These are implicitly added on Mac OSX Lion.  AuthenticationAuthority
# causes the user to be visible in the Users & Groups Preference Pane,
# and the others are just noise, so delete them.
# https://trac.macports.org/ticket/30168
sudo dscl . -delete /Users/ndn AuthenticationAuthority
sudo dscl . -delete /Users/ndn PasswordPolicyOptions
sudo dscl . -delete /Users/ndn dsAttrTypeNative:KerberosKeys
sudo dscl . -delete /Users/ndn dsAttrTypeNative:ShadowHashData

sudo dscl . -create /Users/ndn RealName "NDN User"
sudo dscl . -create /Users/ndn Password "{*}"
sudo dscl . -create /Users/ndn PrimaryGroupID 6363
sudo dscl . -create /Users/ndn NFSHomeDirectory /var/empty
sudo dscl . -create /Users/ndn UserShell /usr/bin/false

# Create group `ndn`
sudo dscl . -create /Groupsndn Password "{*}"
sudo dscl . -create /Groups/ndn RealName "NDN User"
sudo dscl . -create /Groups/ndn PrimaryGroupID 6363
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Creating folders}

Folder {\ttfamily /usr/local/var/log/ndn} should be created and assigned proper user and group\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/log/ndn
sudo chown -R ndn:ndn /usr/local/var/log/ndn
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\ttfamily H\+O\+ME} directory for {\ttfamily nfd} should be created and configured with correct library\textquotesingle{}s config file and contain proper N\+DN security credentials for signing Data packets. This is necessary since default private key storage on O\+SX ({\ttfamily osx-\/keychain}) does not support non-\/interactive access, and file-\/based private key storage needs to be used\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}# Create HOME and generate self-signed NDN certificate for nfd
sudo -s -- ' \
  mkdir -p /usr/local/var/lib/ndn/nfd/.ndn; \
  export HOME=/usr/local/var/lib/ndn/nfd; \
  echo tpm=tpm-file > /usr/local/var/lib/ndn/nfd/.ndn/client.conf; \
  ndnsec-keygen /localhost/daemons/nfd | ndnsec-install-cert -; \
'
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Configuring N\+FD\textquotesingle{}s security}

N\+FD sample configuration allows anybody to create faces, add nexthops to F\+IB, and set strategy choice for namespaces. While such settings could be a good start, it is generally not a good idea to run N\+FD in this mode.

While thorough discussion about security configuration of N\+FD is outside the scope of this document, at least the following change should be done to nfd.\+conf in authorize section\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}authorizations
{
  authorize
  {
    certfile certs/localhost_daemons_nfd.ndncert
    privileges
    {
        faces
        fib
        strategy-choice
    }
  }

  authorize
  {
    certfile any
    privileges
    {
        faces
        strategy-choice
    }
  }
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


While this configuration still allows management of faces and updating strategy choice by anybody, only N\+FD\textquotesingle{}s R\+IB Manager (i.\+e., N\+FD itself) is allowed to manage F\+IB.

As the final step to make this configuration work, N\+FD\textquotesingle{}s self-\/signed certificate needs to be exported into {\ttfamily localhost\+\_\+daemons\+\_\+nfd.\+ndncert} file\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo -s -- '\
  mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/ndn/certs || true; \
  export HOME=/usr/local/var/lib/ndn/nfd; \
  ndnsec-dump-certificate -i /localhost/daemons/nfd > \
    /usr/local/etc/ndn/certs/localhost_daemons_nfd.ndncert; \
  '
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Enable auto-\/start }

\begin{DoxyVerb}sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.named-data.nfd.plist
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Disable auto-\/start }

\begin{DoxyVerb}sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.named-data.nfd.plist\end{DoxyVerb}
