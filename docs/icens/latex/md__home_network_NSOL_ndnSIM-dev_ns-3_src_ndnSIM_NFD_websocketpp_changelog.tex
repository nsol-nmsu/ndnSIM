\item Bug\+: Fixes an issue where some frame data was counted against the max header size limit, resulting in connections that included a lot of frame data immediately after the opening handshake to fail.
\item Bug\+: Fix a type in the name of the set method for {\ttfamily max\+\_\+http\+\_\+body\+\_\+size}. \#406 Thank you jplatte for reporting.

\item B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG U\+T\+I\+L\+I\+TY C\+H\+A\+N\+GE\+: Deprecated methods {\ttfamily \href{http::parser::parse_headers}{\tt http\+::parser\+::parse\+\_\+headers}}, {\ttfamily \href{http::response::parse_complete}{\tt http\+::response\+::parse\+\_\+complete}}, and {\ttfamily \href{http::request::parse_complete}{\tt http\+::request\+::parse\+\_\+complete}} have been removed.
\item Security\+: Disabled S\+S\+Lv3 in example servers.
\item Feature\+: Adds basic support for accessing H\+T\+TP request bodies in the http handler. \#181
\item Feature\+: Adds the ability to register a shutdown handler when using the iostream transport. This provides a clean interface for triggering the shut down of external sockets and other cleanup without hooking in to higher level Web\+Socket handlers.
\item Feature\+: Adds the ability to register a write handler when using the iostream transport. This handler can be used to handle transport output in place of registering an ostream to write to.
\item Feature\+: Adds a new logging policy that outputs to syslog. \#386 Thank you Tom Hughes for submitting the initial version of this policy.
\item Improvement\+: Message payload logging now prints text for text messages rather than binary.
\item Improvement\+: Overhaul of handshake state machine. Should make it impossible for exceptions to bubble out of transport methods like {\ttfamily io\+\_\+service\+::run}.
\item Improvement\+: Overhaul of handshake error reporting. Fail handler error codes will be more detailed and precise. Adds new \mbox{[}fail\mbox{]} and \mbox{[}http\mbox{]} logging channels that log failed websocket connections and successful H\+T\+TP connections respectively. A new aggregate channel package, {\ttfamily alevel\+::access\+\_\+core}, allows enabling connect, disconnect, fail, and http together. Successful H\+T\+TP connections will no longer trigger a fail handler.
\item Improvement\+: Ability to terminate connection during an http handler to cleanly suppress the default outgoing H\+T\+TP response.
\item Documentation\+: Add Sending \& Receiving Messages step to chapter one of the {\ttfamily utility\+\_\+client} tutorial. Update {\ttfamily utility\+\_\+client} example to match.
\item Cleanup\+: Removes unused files \& S\+TL includes. Adds required S\+TL includes. Normalizes include order.
\item Bug\+: Fixes a fatal state error when a handshake response is completed immediately after that handshake times out. \#389
\item Bug\+: Min\+GW fixes; C++11 feature detection, localtime use. \#393 Thank you Schebb for reporting, code, and testing.
\item Bug\+: Fixes an issue where {\ttfamily websocketpp\+::exception\+::what()} could return an out of scope pointer. \#397 Thank you fabioang for reporting.
\item Bug\+: Fixes an issue where endpoints were not reset properly after a call to {\ttfamily endpoint\+::listen} failed. \#390 Thank you wyyqyl for reporting.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG A\+PI C\+H\+A\+N\+GE\+: All Web\+Socket++ methods now throw an exception of type {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwebsocketpp_1_1exception}{websocketpp\+::exception}} which derives from {\ttfamily std\+::exception}. This normalizes all exception types under the standard exception hierarchy and allows Web\+Socket++ exceptions to be caught in the same statement as others. The error code that was previously thrown is wrapped in the exception object and can be accessed via the {\ttfamily websocketpp\+::exception\+::code()} method.
\item B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG A\+PI C\+H\+A\+N\+GE\+: Custom logging policies have some new required constructors that take generic config settings rather than pointers to std\+::ostreams. This allows writing logging policies that do not involve the use of std\+::ostream. This does not affect anyone using the built in logging policies.
\item B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG U\+T\+I\+L\+I\+TY C\+H\+A\+N\+GE\+: {\ttfamily websocketpp\+::lib\+::net\+::htonll} and {\ttfamily websocketpp\+::lib\+::net\+::ntohll} have been prefixed with an underscore to avoid conflicts with similarly named macros in some operating systems. If you are using the Web\+Socket++ provided 64 bit host/network byte order functions you will need to switch to the prefixed versions.
\item B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG U\+T\+I\+L\+I\+TY C\+H\+A\+N\+GE\+: The signature of {\ttfamily base64\+\_\+encode} has changed from {\ttfamily websocketpp\+::base64\+\_\+encode(unsigned char const $\ast$, unsigned int)} to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{namespacewebsocketpp_aff36d40583424a2c879df02219133af8}{websocketpp\+::base64\+\_\+encode(unsigned char const $\ast$, size\+\_\+t)}}.
\item B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG U\+T\+I\+L\+I\+TY C\+H\+A\+N\+GE\+: The signature of {\ttfamily sha1\+::calc} has changed from {\ttfamily websocketpp\+::sha1\+::calc(void const $\ast$, int, unsigned char $\ast$)} to {\ttfamily websocketpp\+::sha1\+::calc(void const $\ast$, size\+\_\+t, unsigned char $\ast$)}
\item Feature\+: Adds incomplete {\ttfamily minimal\+\_\+server} and {\ttfamily minimal\+\_\+client} configs that can be used to build custom configs without pulling in the dependencies of {\ttfamily core} or {\ttfamily core\+\_\+client}. These configs will offer a stable base config to future-\/proof custom configs.
\item Improvement\+: Core library no longer has std\+::iostream as a dependency. std\+::iostream is still required for the optional iostream logging policy and iostream transport.
\item Bug\+: C++11 Chrono support was being incorrectly detected by the {\ttfamily boost\+\_\+config} header. Thank you Max Dmitrichenko for reporting and a patch.
\item Bug\+: use of {\ttfamily std\+::put\+\_\+time} is now guarded by a unique flag rather than a chrono library flag. Thank you Max Dmitrichenko for reporting.
\item Bug\+: Fixes non-\/thread safe use of std\+::localtime. \#347 \#383
\item Compatibility\+: Adjust usage of std\+::min to be more compatible with systems that define a min(...) macro.
\item Compatibility\+: Removes unused parameters from all library, test, and example code. This assists with those developing with -\/\+Werror and -\/\+Wunused-\/parameter \#376
\item Compatibility\+: Renames ntohll and htonll methods to avoid conflicts with platform specific macros. \#358 \#381, \#382 Thank you logotype, unphased, svendjo
\item Cleanup\+: Removes unused functions, fixes variable shadow warnings, normalizes all whitespace in library, examples, and tests to 4 spaces. \#376

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Feature\+: Adds {\ttfamily start\+\_\+perpetual} and {\ttfamily stop\+\_\+perpetual} methods to asio transport These may be used to replace manually managed {\ttfamily asio\+::io\+\_\+service\+::work} objects
\item Feature\+: Allow setting pong and handshake timeouts at runtime.
\item Feature\+: Allows changing the listen backlog queue length.
\item Feature\+: Split tcp init into pre and post init.
\item Feature\+: Adds U\+RI method to extract query string from U\+RI. Thank you Banaan for code. \#298
\item Feature\+: Adds a compile time switch to asio transport config to disable certain multithreading features (some locks, asio strands)
\item Feature\+: Adds the ability to pause reading on a connection. Paused connections will not read more data from their socket, allowing T\+CP flow control to work without blocking the main thread.
\item Feature\+: Adds the ability to specify whether or not to use the {\ttfamily S\+O\+\_\+\+R\+E\+U\+S\+E\+A\+D\+DR} T\+CP socket option. The default for this value has been changed from {\ttfamily true} to {\ttfamily false}.
\item Feature\+: Adds the ability to specify a maximum message size.
\item Feature\+: Adds {\ttfamily close\+::status\+::get\+\_\+string(...)} method to look up a human readable string given a close code value.
\item Feature\+: Adds {\ttfamily connection\+::read\+\_\+all(...)} method to iostream transport as a convenience method for reading all data into the connection buffer without the end user needing to manually loop on {\ttfamily read\+\_\+some}.
\item Improvement\+: Open, close, and pong timeouts can be disabled entirely by setting their duration to 0.
\item Improvement\+: Numerous performance improvements. Including\+: tuned default buffer sizes based on profiling, caching of handler binding for async reads/writes, non-\/malloc allocators for read/write handlers, disabling of a number of questionably useful range sanity checks in tight inner loops.
\item Improvement\+: Cleaned up the handling of T\+LS related errors. T\+LS errors will now be reported with more detail on the info channel rather than all being {\ttfamily tls\+\_\+short\+\_\+read} or {\ttfamily pass\+\_\+through}. In addition, many cases where a T\+LS short read was in fact expected are no longer classified as errors. Expected T\+LS short reads and quasi-\/expected socket shutdown related errors will no longer be reported as unclean Web\+Socket shutdowns to the application. Information about them will remain in the info error channel for debugging purposes.
\item Improvement\+: {\ttfamily start\+\_\+accept} and {\ttfamily listen} errors are now reported to the caller either via an exception or an ec parameter.
\item Improvement\+: Outgoing writes are now batched for improved message throughput and reduced system call and T\+CP frame overhead.
\item Bug\+: Fix some cases of calls to empty lib\+::function objects.
\item Bug\+: Fix memory leak of connection objects due to cached handlers holding on to reference counted pointers. \#310 Thank you otaras for reporting.
\item Bug\+: Fix issue with const endpoint accessors (such as {\ttfamily get\+\_\+user\+\_\+agent}) not compiling due to non-\/const mutex use. \#292 Thank you logofive for reporting.
\item Bug\+: Fix handler allocation crash with multithreaded {\ttfamily io\+\_\+service}.
\item Bug\+: Fixes incorrect whitespace handling in header parsing. \#301 Thank you Wolfram Schroers for reporting
\item Bug\+: Fix a crash when parsing empty H\+T\+TP headers. Thank you Thingol for reporting.
\item Bug\+: Fix a crash following use of the {\ttfamily stop\+\_\+listening} function. Thank you Thingol for reporting.
\item Bug\+: Fix use of variable names that shadow function parameters. The library should compile cleanly with -\/\+Wshadow now. Thank you giszo for reporting. \#318
\item Bug\+: Fix an issue where {\ttfamily set\+\_\+open\+\_\+handshake\+\_\+timeout} was ignored by server code. Thank you Robin Rowe for reporting.
\item Bug\+: Fix an issue where custom timeout values weren\textquotesingle{}t being propagated from endpoints to new connections.
\item Bug\+: Fix a number of memory leaks related to server connection failures. \#323 \#333 \#334 \#335 Thank you droppy and aydany for reporting and patches. reporting.
\item Compatibility\+: Fix compile time conflict with Visual Studio\textquotesingle{}s M\+I\+N/\+M\+AX macros. Thank you Robin Rowe for reporting.
\item Documentation\+: Examples and test suite build system now defaults to clang on OS X

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item H\+T\+TP requests ending normally are no longer logged as errors. Thank you Banaan for reporting. \#294
\item Eliminates spurious expired timers in certain error conditions. Thank you Banaan for reporting. \#295
\item Consolidates all bundled library licenses into the C\+O\+P\+Y\+I\+NG file. \#294
\item Updates bundled sha1 library to one with a cleaner interface and more straight-\/forward license. Thank you lotodore for reporting and Evgeni Golov for reviewing. \#294
\item Re-\/introduces strands to asio transport, allowing {\ttfamily io\+\_\+service} thread pools to be used (with some limitations).
\item Removes endpoint code that kept track of a connection list that was never used anywhere. Removes a lock and reduces connection creation/deletion complexity from O(log n) to O(1) in the number of connections.
\item A number of internal changes to transport A\+P\+Is
\item Deprecates iostream transport {\ttfamily readsome} in favor of {\ttfamily read\+\_\+some} which is more consistent with the naming of the rest of the library.
\item Adds preliminary signaling to iostream transport of eof and fatal transport errors
\item Updates transport code to use shared pointers rather than raw pointers to prevent asio from retaining pointers to connection methods after the connection goes out of scope. \#293 Thank you otaras for reporting.
\item Fixes an issue where custom headers couldn\textquotesingle{}t be set for client connections Thank you Jerry Win and Wolfram Schroers for reporting.
\item Fixes a compile error on visual studio when using interrupts. Thank you Javier Rey Neira for reporting this.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Minor refactor to bundled sha1 library
\item H\+T\+TP header comparisons are now case insensitive. \#220, \#275
\item Refactors U\+RI to be exception free and not use regular expressions. This eliminates the dependency on boost or C++11 regex libraries allowing native C++11 usage on G\+CC 4.\+4 and higher and significantly reduces staticly built binary sizes.
\item Updates handling of Server and User-\/\+Agent headers to better handle custom settings and allow suppression of these headers for security purposes.
\item Fix issue where pong timeout handler always fired. Thank you Steven Klassen for reporting this bug.
\item Add ping and pong endpoint wrapper methods
\item Add {\ttfamily get\+\_\+request()} pass through method to connection to allow calling methods specific to the H\+T\+TP policy in use.
\item Fix issue compile error with {\ttfamily W\+E\+B\+S\+O\+C\+K\+E\+T\+P\+P\+\_\+\+S\+T\+R\+I\+C\+T\+\_\+\+M\+A\+S\+K\+I\+NG} enabled and another issue where {\ttfamily W\+E\+B\+S\+O\+C\+K\+E\+T\+P\+P\+\_\+\+S\+T\+R\+I\+C\+T\+\_\+\+M\+A\+S\+K\+I\+NG} was not applied to incoming messages.
